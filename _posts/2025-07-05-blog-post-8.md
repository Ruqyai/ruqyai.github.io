# In the Age of AI Hype, What Does It Mean to Build a Real AI Product?
![AI Product Lifecycle](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ruqyai/ar/refs/heads/main/images/AI-Product-Lifecycle.gif)

In a time when the hype around artificial intelligence grows louder every day, I realized something simple yet essential: if AI does not solve a real problem, it has no real value.

Every day I see news about AI new technologies new models amazing capabilities and impressive numbers But amid this noise I find myself more attracted to people's stories

I started joining entrepreneur communities listening to their concerns and experiences despite the variety in their ideas and backgrounds Yet there is a clear common factor among them in this era AI represents an opportunity and the question they all ask is how can we seize it with an innovative idea

But this question was not what occupied me It was a deeper question beyond finding the idea How does the idea succeed How does it turn from a spark in the mind into a tangible product that truly makes a difference in people's lives

Here I started returning to the meeting point between technology and human experience I was not looking into codes or models but seeking meaning How do we create something that truly serves the user How do we turn AI into a tangible impact not just a technical show

## My Journey to Discover AI Product Management

From this question I began exploring different disciplines outside my specialization but complementary to it I was drawn to a course on product building where I learned a lot But let me specifically tell you about the AI Product Lifecycle

A calm methodology far from noise It draws a roadmap for the idea from the moment it is born through its growth and until its end

I understood then that building a successful product is not only about building and training models but about deep awareness of every stage And one question that never leaves us

Is what we build making a difference

During my learning journey I discovered seven main stages every real product goes through Each stage was like a test of the idea's truthfulness and its worthiness to grow

## Conceive

The first stage is conceive Here the questions begin Is there a real problem Will anyone use this product Can AI make a difference here This stage is unclear full of ambiguity and deep thought

## Plan

Then comes the plan stage We begin translating the idea into a plan Who is the user What are the core functions How will we build this product How will we launch it It is the moment of turning vision into practical steps

## Develop

Next is the develop stage where the team starts actual work System design training models testing performance and user experience Every step brings us closer to the full product vision

## Qualify

Then comes the qualify stage We pause to ask Does what we built work Is the model accurate Does the user feel this product was designed for them No product can be launched without this validation

## Launch

Then comes the launch moment The moment we share with the world what we built A moment full of anticipation excitement and sometimes fear We are not only launching a product but starting a real relationship with users

## Deliver

But the story does not end here The deliver stage begins after launch We monitor interaction improve the experience listen to feedback and develop based on what we learn

## Retire

Finally comes the retire stage Every product has a lifespan And there may come a time when we need to end its journey Whether due to market changes end of need or better alternatives We must plan for the end just as we planned for the beginning with responsibility and respect for the user

What I learned on this journey encouraged me to dive deeper to understand the environment where we can employ AI to build products with real impact Products that serve people ease their lives and lighten their burdens

We do not only need smart products but conscious products Products that start with an honest idea and a simple question

Is there a real problem to solve
