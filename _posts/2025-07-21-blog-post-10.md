# Reflections on Product Prioritization Strategies
**From an AI Product Management Course**
![Strategies](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ruqyai/ar/refs/heads/main/images/Prioritization.gif)
*A journey of understanding, evaluating, and gaining deeper awareness of what truly makes a difference in the world of products.*

When working on products in a constantly changing and complex environment, the decision of *‚ÄúWhat should we build first?‚Äù* becomes a strategic one that shouldn‚Äôt be taken lightly. Prioritization isn‚Äôt just about sorting ideas ‚Äî it‚Äôs an art and a mindset. It‚Äôs a balance between value and effort, between what the customer needs and what the team can deliver.

In this post, I‚Äôm sharing the strategies I learned in the course ‚Äî not as a ready-made list, but as reflections in pursuit of deeper understanding.



### 1. **Impact vs. Effort Matrix**

**Concept:**
This matrix categorizes ideas into four quadrants based on:

* **Impact**: How much of a difference will this idea make?
* **Effort**: How much time and resources will it require?

**Result:**
A clear visualization that distinguishes quick wins from large or draining projects.

**What did I learn?**

* Big wins aren‚Äôt always the best options.
* Great, low-effort ideas can be overlooked while focusing on more complex tasks.
* "Impact" should be evaluated from multiple perspectives: customer, revenue, team.
* "Effort" isn‚Äôt just time ‚Äî it includes resources, budget, skills, and even mental pressure.



### 2. **Kano Model**

**Concept:**
Features are classified into:

* **Basic**: Their absence causes dissatisfaction.
* **Performance**: The better they are, the higher the satisfaction.
* **Delighters**: Unexpected but pleasantly surprise the customer.

There are also neutral or even negative features in some contexts.

**What did I learn?**

* What we consider ‚Äúinnovative‚Äù might mean nothing to the user.
* The **timing** and **context** of a feature can be more important than the feature itself.
* Communicating with customers and analyzing their experience reveals what *truly* satisfies them.



### 3. **RICE Framework (Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort)**

**Concept:**
A tool that scores each idea across four criteria:

* **Reach**: How many users will it affect?
* **Impact**: How strong will the effect be?
* **Confidence**: How certain am I about my assumptions?
* **Effort**: What will it cost to execute?

**What did I learn?**

* ‚ÄúReach‚Äù isn‚Äôt just about numbers ‚Äî it‚Äôs about *real* influence.
* Confidence needs data, not just gut feeling.
* RICE is a great way to stay neutral and reduce bias.



### 4. **Weighted Scoring**

**Concept:**
A tool based on setting multiple criteria (e.g., revenue, customer satisfaction), assigning weights to each, and scoring each idea accordingly.

**What did I learn?**

* Weight distribution reveals what we *truly* value.
* Team involvement in setting weights is essential to avoid bias.
* Surprises are a natural part of this exercise ‚Äî and can lead to better decisions.



### 5. **SWOT and PEST Analysis**

**Concept:**

* **SWOT**: Internal (Strengths & Weaknesses) and external (Opportunities & Threats) analysis.
* **PEST**: Political, Economic, Social, and Technological factor analysis.

**What did I learn?**

* Focusing only inward weakens strategic vision.
* External environments can completely reshape strategy.
* These analyses aren‚Äôt one-time tasks ‚Äî they‚Äôre tools to revisit regularly.



### 6. **Product Thinking in Phases**

**Concept:**
Breaking product development into phases:

* **MVP (Minimum Viable Product)**: The essentials.
* **Enhancements**: What improves the experience.
* **Differentiation and Scaling**: What sets the product apart and drives growth.

**What did I learn?**

* Striving for perfection early on does more harm than good.
* Time and resources define what‚Äôs realistic to launch.
* Growth isn‚Äôt an emotional decision ‚Äî it‚Äôs a strategic one.
